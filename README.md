# Migratory-Birds
This code solves the Migratory Birds problem by finding the most frequently sighted bird type, with ties broken by selecting the smallest bird ID. The code counts sightings of each bird type (1-5) using an array, then finds the type with the highest count by prioritizing smaller IDs when counts are equal.
